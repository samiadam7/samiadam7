## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sami and I am a senior at the University of Virginia majoring in Statistics and Business planning on completing a MS in Statistics. I am interested in machine learning applications, especially in sports, health, and energy!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a machine learning system to beat my friends in Fantasy Premier League using what I am learning from the two books below!
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently reading [Designing Machine Learning Systems](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-machine-learning/9781098107956/) by Chip Huyen and [Fundamentals of Data Engineering](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-data/9781098108298/) by Joe Reis.
